            1. removes the features from the self.feature_list that have too many words.
            As language ambiguity is very high, we cannot cover all possibilities in the choice of words and
            sentence structures. Therefore, the final list might contain wrong entries, which are typically
            long sentences. This methods removes those self.feature_list entries that have more words than specified in
            self.feature_word_threshold.

            2. filters features that contain non-informative information. This method is keyword based and uses
            keywords that the authors found by looking into extracted features.
            For example the sentence: "view documents and more" resolves in the app features: "view documents" and
            "view more", whereas, the second feature is labeled as non-informative, since 'more' is not defined

            3. filter app features that contain grammar subtrees because of their complexity

    # 5 Please make an ipad version of whatsapp.
    # 5 This is a good app but I think people should have snapchat because snapchat has cute filters and you could call and video call and put stuff in your story and you can add friends on snapchat and you can also text your friends in snapchat and play games.
    # 5 great. I use it loads and find it really helpful. I pretty much made this review to ask this question. my friends' group chats always have different colours for people's names but mine has no colours. Why is this?
    # 5 Still an awesome app. Sometimes i wish WhatsApp have on and off button, coz i just want to ignore everybody for a moment. ??
    # 5 all r very nice but we needed some more clarity in pic while video calling
    # 1 plzz add this feature then show the profile picture only one person like in a status
    # 5 best way to connect to my friends locally and internationally and share clear videos and pictures!!
    # 1 When we will forwarding the message limitations of 5 people, but we need Unlimited people/group. After the complain it's not changed.
    # 5 I use it a lot, really great app.. But I need to know.. Would the blocked contacts be informed or notified if I change my phone number?
    # 4 Great messenger. But still no full darkmode.
    # 3 sometimes message notification not ringing
    # 1 cant share video
    # 3 it's very interesting yo share your sadness in status.
    # 5 Whatsapp, can you make *message editing* option?
    # 3 please add default status downloader update it quick for further more subscribers
    # 3 it OK but the call cut off in the middle of the conversation ...need. to be more clear
    # 5 So convenient specially with video call
    # 1 We need to be able to use whatsapp without data or WiFi
    # 4 incoming call doesnt show up on lockscreen
    # 3 video calls not clear ??
    # 5 just a little suggestion, can whatsapp make an option where you can schedule a mute for certain group. instead of setting the group mute for 8 hours everyday, it already been scheduled to mute from this hour to this hour on this certain day. i think this is very helpful to mute a group during working days.
    # 5 A nice improvement... Better than the last.
    # 4 i can't see if what time the person who is online or not..
    # 3 This is garbage, I prefer the old version
    # 4 It's nice. But seeing people's comments on other people's statuses would be more fun.
    # 1 update version is not working properly. mia1 ph. do something as early as possible.
    # 4 Great app, but dislikes updates
    # 5 I love whatsapp!! So useful...to write with...call or send videos and photos and links and share and copy paste!!
    # 5 Its good cause its reception is always good ,sound quality during calls wheather its video or voice or overseas calll is always on perfection, Keep up the good work
